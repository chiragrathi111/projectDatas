It is a set of techniques which uses the planned orders by MRP, open manufacturing orders, manufacturing resources and the work-flows to calculate the required time for each resource along with the available time. With this information, we are able to balance the time demand with the available time. Through the knowledge of the required and available capacities it is possible to adjust the Master Production Schedule(MPS) until we arrive at a realistic one.
